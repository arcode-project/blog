      <h1>ARCODE</h1>
        <div>
          <p align="justify">ARCODE is an action-aware combat model proposed for massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) running on cloud gaming platforms to improve the compression efficiency of graphics rendering cloud servers and provide players a better visual quality with the same bitrate compared to the traditional approach. Because video compression removes spatiotemporal redundancies, fewer bits are required to encode, at a certain fidelity, the videos with less motion. Arcode is aware of game semantics and captures different action data for different object types in the combat area of MMORPGs, and based on the actions each object can perform in each game state to alter the state of other objects, the model considers the importance of the object. Based on the significance of each object to the player in each game state, the model adjusts the frequency of each object's position updates in the scene. By reducing the number of motion updates in the scene, the cloud server's encoder consumes fewer bits to encode the video at a certain fidelity compared to the traditional approach.</p>
